Using sound:
  Songs(TMF format) can be loaded in any free memory region. Remember the song
  must be compiled for a certain memory location.
  BGM2TMF now also supports sourcecode output. Songs in sourcecode output (TMS)
  can be INCLUDEd anywhere and played in-place. No relocation is necessary. This
  is especially nice for sound effects.

  Call R_MPLAY to initialise the music.
  Call R_MINTER every VBlank (or any other fixed interval) to play music.
  Call R_MSTOP to stop music, or call M_PLAY to initialise another.

  R_MINTER can be called while music is not playing (or paused), this is no
  problem. R_MPLAY will automatically call R_MSTOP, so calling R_MSTOP is
  not necessary before starting a new song.
