You should have downloaded this zip file from "RPG SoundTest". All of these files have been directly ripped by me (minimidicomposer) from the CAPCOM VS SNK 2 Millionaire Fighting 2001 Original Soundtrack and then converted to uncompressed WAV files. Feel free to visit my blog for more RPG Maker-related downloads. Please do not reupload these to your own site without at least referencing where you originally got them. Thanks!
